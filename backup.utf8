What should be backed up?


Description: 
   for backup and restore we were thinking about using the dump procedures provided by mongodb and mysql, respectively.
   then we would use the backups from our IT department to backup the dumps.
   for restore we would use the restore procedures provided by mongodb and mysql, respectively.

Questions:
   - Do you see anything wrong with the proposal ?
   - If so, could you give a few pointer about how to attack it?

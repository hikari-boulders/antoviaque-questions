QUESTION
========
MAKO.1: How does one use mako templates? (I m not asking how to write a template, just where to put them and how to make the rest of edx interact with them!)
 
Example: I want every yotuube video to be followed by an html block that says "here was a youtube video!". For this I make a template called videohtml, let's say. 
Where do I put the template (which folder), where do I signal that videohtml is a template name?
